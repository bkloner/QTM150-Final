Therefore, the late 1970s, due to incredibly high interest rates, would have seen the least years required for the saver to wait to buy a median priced home. To the contrary, as shown in task 6, the renter is able to purchase a more expensive home when in interest rates are lower. Thus, the renter would be able to afford the most expsenvie home possible, given a certain house spend and income, now, or in the lat 2000s and early 2010s."
